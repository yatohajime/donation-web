He also said that Allah offers relief on the Day of Judgement for those who give sadaqa: “The believer's shade on the Day of Resurrection will be their charity,” (Hadith, Tirmidhi)</p>

                    expended. We are investing in three primary needs of flood affected people based on
                    their situation.

                    <p>Even in these difficult times, every child wishes to continue their studies; in hopes of a 
                        brighter future. A future where they contribute in helping people who suffered just like they are now. So to further encourage these youthful dreamers we're contributing to their education.

                    <p>The floods have washed away residential homes of countless families. They no longer have a place to return to or live peacefully. No place where fond memories are pervaiding, all those family moments; just washed away while they were helplessly witnessing this carnage. Until this flood subsides, they need a temporary yet home-like ambience to find solace with each other.So, we're contributing to building them a shelter </p>

                    <h3>Medicine for the sick</h3>
                    <p>Floods are notorious for birthing water borne diseases. Furthermore, injuries are rampant due to people's efforts in saving themselves and helping others. In such moments, even the scantiest of medical facilities are life-saving. In order to provide for such a crucial need, we're contributing for their medicine.</p>
